        <h2 id="history-title">Our Story</h2>
        <div class="history-section">
            <p>In the summer of 1998, nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, a small town named Clearwater was quietly flourishing. Known for its breathtaking landscapes and roaring rivers, Clearwater was a hidden gem for outdoor enthusiasts. It was here that an extraordinary journey began—one that would transform the adventure tourism industry</p>
            <h3>The Dream</h3>
            <p>Thomas "Tom" Rivers, a former marine biologist turned thrill-seeker, had always been captivated by the power and beauty of nature. After years of working in research labs and diving into oceanic expeditions, Tom felt a growing yearning for a new adventure. One that combined his love for the wild with his desire to connect people with the natural world. During a rafting trip with friends on the turbulent waters of the Gauley River, Tom experienced an epiphany. He realized that the thrill of navigating the river’s rapids was not just an adventure, but a way to foster a deeper appreciation for the environment.</p>
            <h3>The Birth of an Idea</h3>
            <p>Tom envisioned a rafting company that wasn’t just about the rush of adrenaline, but also about education and conservation. He wanted to create a company that would offer thrilling experiences while promoting environmental stewardship. With this vision in mind, Tom reached out to his long-time friend, Lisa Green. Lisa, an environmental scientist with a knack for business, shared Tom’s passion for adventure and the environment. Together, they began to shape their dream into reality.</p>
            <h3>Today</h3>
            <p>
                Today, Dry Oar stands as a testament to the vision of its founders. With a fleet of rafts, a dedicated team, and a community of loyal adventurers, the company continues to thrive. Tom and Lisa, though no longer guiding every trip, remain the heart and soul of the operation, constantly seeking new ways to share the beauty and thrill of the rivers with the world.
                
                And so, the legacy of Dry Oar endures, a living story of adventure, conservation, and the enduring bond between humanity and the wild.</p>
